# Important note on path specifications using rsync: A trailing slash ('/') on
# the SOURCE folder means "copy the contents of this directory". Without a
# trailing slash it means "copy the directory".

# In the example above, the folder SOURCE on rackham will be copied to
# /projects/XXX-projects/nrmuser/SOURCE on nrmdna01. On the other hand, say that
# we added a couple of files to /path/to/SOURCE, using
# /path/to/SOURCE/ nrmuser@nrmdna01.nrm.se:/projects/XXX-projects/nrmuser/SOURCE
# would add those files in /projects/XXX-projects/nrmuser/SOURCE.
# Important is the trailing slash (or not) on SOURCE.
